       <br>Dear whom it may concern,<br>
       <br>
       <p>I am an aspiring <span class="note">front-end developer.</span><br>
<br>
<br>I would like to express my interest in the internship role at <span class="logo">The Space InBetw<span class="invisible">ee</span>n</span>. I am currently in my second year of studying Computer Science at The University of Auckland.<br>

<br>I am passionate about web development and hence I came to know about this position at the Auckland CSS meetup. I would love the opportunity to work as an intern amongst other talented people at The Space InBetween to acquire invaluable skills to contribute towards my development as an aspiring front-end developer. I love the fact that front-end developers can manipulate what users see and interact with through coding, it enables me to be a technical and visual person. I love learning new things and I am a meticulous learner who learns best visually. To me, the idea of being able to make an impact on the user interface is particularly satisfying. Furthermore, I am excited to be a front-end developer as it also gives me the opportunity to show my creativity.<br>

<br>I love working with HTML, CSS and Javascript and I am eager to learn new languages, hence, I am currently experimenting with SASS. During my spare time I enjoy exploring other developers' work on CodePen and I came to appreciate open sharing of code as it enables ideas to be shared and encourages creativity. I also enjoy reading books, bike riding and baking. I also like travelling because it gives me the chance to learn something new and helps me keep an open perspective. I like the idea of how baking is similar to coding as they both involve making deliberate decisions through multiple processes which are essential in achieving a rewarding outcome.<br>

<br>As an intern at The Space Inbetween, I am confident that I will be able to deliver work with enthusiasm and positivity. I am also capable of working collaboratively with other team members as I have proficient communication skills. I was fortunate enough to be nominated as a student representative and a Korean leader in New Zealand's largest secondary school. I was responsible for representing the voice of more than 1000 fellow students. Through this role, I was able to enhance my communication skills with all age groups such as staff members, parents, visitors and students. I would be grateful if you could please consider me as a candidate for an internship role at The Space InBetween. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,
<br>
<br>
<br>Young-Ju Lee<br></p>
